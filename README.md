## Jersey City - Citi Bike Histories December 2023 – January 2024 

### Introduction 

Acting as a Data Analyst for the City officials, analysis of the following data from Citi Bike was used to determine metrics about the trends that were occurring with users of these bikes in both Jersey City and New York City. The data source was Jersey City Citi Bike trip histories starting on December 1, 2023 through January 31, 2024. There are 109,341 entries of data that describes the ride ID, classic bike vs. electric bike, start date and time, end date and time, start station name and ID, end station name and ID, start latitude and longitude, end latitude and longitude, and whether the customer was either a casual rider or a member.

#### Members/Casual Dashboard
In the members/casual dashboard, the different charts highlight causal vs. member riders, classic bike vs. electric bike, the type of bike used per day, and the rider’s chosen start and end stations. Immediately, in the first chart “Casual Rider vs. Member Rider,” there are more member riders than the casual riders. The quantity of riders overall remained consistent, although there was a slight decrease in the month of January. In the second chart “Classic Bike vs. Electric Bike,” both member and casual riders preferred classic bikes over electric bikes. And this also follows the same trend showing the quantity overall is similar to the first chart: most of the users are member bikers. 

Next, the third chart is the “Type of Bike Used per Day.” Here, it is clear there is a consistent number of classic bikes used during the months of December and January; however, the amount of electric bikes increase significantly January 1st, 2024. The reason for this is unknown. Other data, such as weather information, may help understand this trend. Theoretically, a dip in temperature may have caused the riders to want to conserve energy and chose the electric bike. This theory would need to be checked. 

The final chart on this dashboard, “Member vs. Casual Riders Chosen Stations,” shows the different stations the riders preferred. This included both start and end stations. Immediately, the trend shows that the casual riders chose mostly in Jersey City. Since this dataset is designated for Jersey City, that may explain why that trend occurred. Further information can be gathered in this dashboard by selecting each chart to dynamically change and show more detail of that individual selection. 

#### Stations
Next, in the stations dashboard, the charts highlight popular start stations, longest ride end stations, and a map of the popular end stations. Overall, the most popular start station was Hoboken Terminal – River St. & Hudson. This location is a huge commuter hub and gives access to other transportation of commuter trains and ferries. In the “Longest Rider End Stations,” the chart shows the end station that riders used to end their longest rides; this is reflected in the map below. The members favorite end station was Grove St. Path and the casual rider’s station was Hoboken Terminal – River St. & Hudson. It is also clear that members had many longer rides than the casual riders. Using the dynamic dashboard, the selection of the charts will give a great understanding. If a selection is made in the longest ride end station chart, the popular start station will reflect where those users most likely started their rides.
